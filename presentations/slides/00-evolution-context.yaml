          THE MARKET SHIFT
          ════════════════
          
          BEFORE CHATGPT (2022)
          ────────────────────
          User Expectation Model:
          • Click buttons
          • Fill forms
          • Navigate menus
          • Learn UI structure
          • Repeat every session
          
          App Philosophy:
          "Users adapt to our interface"
          
          ─────────────────────────────
          
          AFTER CHATGPT (2023-2025)
          ────────────────────────────
          User Expectation Model:
          • Express intent naturally
          • Get results instantly
          • AI understands context
          • Natural conversation
          • Personalized experience
          
          App Philosophy:
          "We adapt to user intent"
          
          ─────────────────────────────
          
          THE IMPLICATION
          ───────────────
          Traditional UIs now feel:
          ✗ Inflexible
          ✗ Clunky
          ✗ Outdated
          ✗ Wrong
          
          Users expect:
          ✓ Conversation
          ✓ Understanding
          ✓ Adaptation
          ✓ Intelligence

        title: "The Expectation Shift"
        narration: |
          Users don't want to learn your UI
          Users want to tell you what they want
          That's not a feature request
          That's the baseline now
          Companies ignoring this are losing market share

          USER EXPECTATION EVOLUTION
          ══════════════════════════
          
          GENERATION 1: Command Line (1980s)
          └─ Users learn syntax
             "ls -la /home/user"
          
          GENERATION 2: GUI Era (1990s-2000s)
          └─ Users learn UI
             "File → Open → Choose Folder"
          
          GENERATION 3: Mobile/Touch (2010s)
          └─ Users learn gestures
             "Tap, swipe, long-press"
          
          GENERATION 4: Conversational (2020s)
          └─ Users express intent
             "Show me red dresses under $100"
          
          ─────────────────────────────────
          
          THE PATTERN
          ───────────
          Each generation:
          • Shifts burden from user to system
          • Makes human expression more natural
          • Reduces cognitive load
          • Raises baseline expectations
          
          We've reached natural language.
          You can't go backwards.
          You can only improve from here.

          The question isn't if, it's when

          ════════════════════
          
          Three Years Ago (2022):
          "AI in our app" = Innovation
          "Let's add a chatbot" = Competitive advantage
          
          Today (2025):
          "No AI orchestration" = Risk
          "Traditional UI only" = Obsolete
          "Generic LLM integration" = Non-differentiator
          
          Tomorrow (2026-2027):
          "Not AI-native" = Uncompetitive
          "Not fine-tuned" = Low quality
          "Not optimized for agents" = Lost users
