        title: "The AI-Native Revolution"
        narration: |
          Two game-changing developments are happening RIGHT NOW:
          MCPs (Model Context Protocol) - New standard for AI integration
          Advanced LLMs - Understanding intent, routing, rendering
          When you combine them, everything changes.

        title: "Why Now? The Problem We Solved"
        narration: |
          Before 2024: LLM integration was fragile
          Each company built custom integration
          No standard way to describe services to LLMs
          LLMs hallucinated tool names and parameters
          Building AI applications was unpredictable
          That world is ending.

          ❌ PRE-2024: Chaos
          ├─ No standard for describing services to LLMs
          ├─ Every company reinvents the wheel
          ├─ Hallucination: LLM invents function names
          ├─ Hallucination: LLM invents parameters
          ├─ Unpredictable behavior
          └─ No test coverage for LLM behavior
          
          ✅ POST-2024: Order
          ├─ Model Context Protocol (MCP)
          ├─ Services describe themselves formally
          ├─ LLM can't hallucinate what doesn't exist
          ├─ Standard testing & validation
          ├─ Production-grade reliability
          └─ AI-Native Architecture possible

        title: "What Changed: MCP Announcement"
        narration: |
          Anthropic released Model Context Protocol (MCP)
          Standard format for services to describe themselves to LLMs
          Like API documentation, but designed for AI.
          Open standard. Not vendor-locked.
          Changes everything about how we build.
