        title: "MCP: LLM + Enterprise Knowledge = Intelligence"
        narration: |
          Generic LLM: "Here are good headphones"
          Enterprise LLM: "Here are our models, in your price range, approved by your company"
          LLM has become smart: understands context
          LLM integrates with systems: executes within rules
          LLM provides enterprise expertise: not generic advice
          This is the shift that matters.

          GENERIC LLM vs ENTERPRISE CONTEXT
          ══════════════════════════════════
          
          User: "Show me headphones within my budget"
          
          WITHOUT MCP (Generic LLM):
          ├─ LLM: "Here are popular headphones..."
          ├─ Prices from 2024 training data
          ├─ Doesn't know YOUR budget
          ├─ Doesn't know YOUR approved vendors
          ├─ Doesn't know YOUR company policies
          ├─ Not useful in enterprise context
          └─ User: "That's not what we need"
          
          WITH MCP (Enterprise Context):
          ═════════════════════════════════════
          
          User: "Show me headphones within my budget"
          
          ├─ LLM sees MCP: enterprise integration
          ├─ Accesses: Your budget policy ($500 max)
          ├─ Accesses: Your approved vendors
          ├─ Accesses: Your company preferences
          ├─ Accesses: Real-time inventory
          ├─ Accesses: Your procurement rules
          ├─ Returns: "3 options from approved vendors"
          │           "All under $500"
          │           "In stock at nearest location"
          └─ Result: Perfectly contextualized answer
          
          THE BREAKTHROUGH
          ════════════════
          LLM became powerful not by being generic
          But by integrating with YOUR enterprise
          Domain knowledge meets language understanding
          This is enterprise intelligence
