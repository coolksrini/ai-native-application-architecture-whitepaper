        title: "The Traditional Approach"
        narration: |
          Every client makes direct REST API calls
          Each endpoint is independent
          User must know which endpoint to call
          No coordination between calls
          Fixed response format for all use cases

          # TRADITIONAL: Direct API Calls
          
          Client (UI) → Multiple Endpoints
          
          GET /api/products?category=gaming
            ↓ [JSON Array]
          
          GET /api/products/123
            ↓ [Product Details]
          
          POST /api/orders
            ↓ [Order ID]
          
          GET /api/orders/user/123
            ↓ [Order History]
          
          POST /api/payments
            ↓ [Receipt]
          
          ❌ PROBLEMS
          • Multiple round trips (slow)
          • Client coordinates calls
          • Fixed format for all use cases
          • Duplicated logic in every client
          • No natural language interface

        title: "The AI-Native Approach"
        narration: |
          User speaks naturally to one endpoint
          System understands intent
          Routes intelligently to services
          Aggregates results
          Returns adaptive UI
          Intelligence in the middle.

          # AI-NATIVE: One Natural Query
          
          User: "Show me gaming laptops under $2000"
              ↓
          Intent Classifier (LLM + MCP)
              ↓
          Classified Intent: SEARCH_PRODUCTS
          Parameters: {category: gaming, max_price: 2000}
              ↓
          Intelligent Router → ProductService.search()
              ↓
          Results Aggregator
              ↓
          UI Selector (LLM chooses component)
          Options: ListComponent, GridComponent, 
                   TableComponent, CardComponent
              ↓
          Adaptive Response
              ↓
          User sees perfectly formatted results
          
          ✅ BENEFITS
          • Single query (fast)
          • System coordinates
          • Adaptive UI per intent
          • Reusable logic
          • Natural language interface
