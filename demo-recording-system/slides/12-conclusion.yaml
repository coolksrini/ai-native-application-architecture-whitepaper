          THE REVOLUTION: MCP + LLM
          ═════════════════════════
          
          OLD PARADIGM (2023)
          ─────────────────
          LLM
          ├─ Brilliant but unpredictable
          ├─ Can't reliably call tools
          ├─ Hallucination problems
          ├─ No standard interface
          └─ Each integration was custom
          
          Result: AI features felt like experiments
          
          ──────────────────────────────
          
          NEW PARADIGM (2024+)
          ───────────────────
          MCP (Model Context Protocol)
          ├─ Standard service definition
          ├─ LLM can't hallucinate
          ├─ Validated tool calls
          ├─ Repeatable, testable
          └─ Production-grade reliability
          
          + LLM (Advanced reasoning)
          ├─ Understands intent
          ├─ Orchestrates services
          ├─ Makes intelligent decisions
          ├─ Provides natural interaction
          └─ Adapts to context
          
          = AI-NATIVE APPLICATIONS
          ├─ Natural interfaces
          ├─ Intelligent routing
          ├─ Adaptive responses
          ├─ Production reliability
          ├─ Enterprise-grade
          └─ THIS IS THE FUTURE
          
          Who's building these?
          ├─ Forward-thinking companies
