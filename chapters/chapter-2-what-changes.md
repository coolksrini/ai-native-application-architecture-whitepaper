# Chapter 2: What Changes

## Introduction

While the microservices architectural pattern remains valid in AI-native applications, several critical layers undergo fundamental transformation. This chapter examines each change in detail, with real-world examples and implementation guidance.

---

## Change 1: API Protocol (REST → MCP)

### The Transformation

```
FROM: REST/GraphQL/gRPC with OpenAPI specs
TO: Model Context Protocol (MCP) with tool schemas
```

### Why It Matters

REST APIs were designed for **human developers** who read documentation and write integration code. MCP is designed for **AI agents** that discover and use tools at runtime.

### Side-by-Side Comparison

#### Traditional REST API

```python
# FastAPI REST endpoint
@app.get("/api/orders/{order_id}")
async def get_order(
    order_id: str,
    user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Get order details by ID.
    
    Returns 404 if order not found.
    Returns 403 if user doesn't own order.
    """
    order = db.query(Order).filter(Order.id == order_id).first()
    if not order:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404)
    if order.user_id != user.id:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403)
    return order
```

**OpenAPI spec (for developers):**
```yaml
/api/orders/{order_id}:
  get:
    summary: Get order details
    parameters:
      - name: order_id
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          type: string
    responses:
      200:
        description: Order found
      404:
        description: Order not found
      403:
        description: Forbidden
```

**Developer workflow:**
1. Read OpenAPI docs
2. Write client code: `fetch('/api/orders/123')`
3. Handle HTTP status codes
4. Parse JSON response
5. Deploy client code

#### MCP Tool

```python
# FastAPI MCP tool
@app.mcp_tool()
async def get_order(
    order_id: str,
    user_context: UserContext = Depends(get_user_context)
) -> Order:
    """
    Retrieve detailed information about a specific order.
    
    Use this when the user asks about a specific order by ID,
    or when you need to get details after finding an order.
    
    Args:
        order_id: The unique identifier of the order (e.g., "ORD-123456")
    
    Returns:
        Complete order information including items, status, and tracking
    
    Raises:
        NotFoundError: Order doesn't exist
        PermissionError: User doesn't have access to this order
    """
    order = db.query(Order).filter(Order.id == order_id).first()
    if not order:
        raise NotFoundError(f"Order {order_id} not found")
    if order.user_id != user_context.user_id:
        raise PermissionError("Cannot access another user's order")
    return order
```

**MCP tool schema (for AI):**
```json
{
  "name": "get_order",
  "description": "Retrieve detailed information about a specific order. Use this when the user asks about a specific order by ID, or when you need to get details after finding an order.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "order_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The unique identifier of the order (e.g., 'ORD-123456')"
      }
    },
    "required": ["order_id"]
  },
  "output_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "id": {"type": "string"},
      "status": {"type": "string"},
      "items": {"type": "array"},
      "total": {"type": "number"},
      "created_at": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

**AI workflow:**
1. User says: "What's the status of order 123?"
2. AI discovers `get_order` tool
3. AI calls: `get_order(order_id="123")`
4. AI receives structured response
5. AI presents: "Your order #123 is currently being shipped"

### Key Differences

| Aspect | REST | MCP |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Consumer** | Human developers | AI agents |
| **Discovery** | Read docs, hardcode | Runtime discovery |
| **Integration** | Write client code | AI interprets schema |
| **Errors** | HTTP status codes | Semantic error messages |
| **Versioning** | URL paths (/v1, /v2) | Tool versioning |
| **Documentation** | For humans (Swagger UI) | For AI (semantic descriptions) |

### Real-World Example: Stripe

**Today (REST):**
```javascript
// Developer writes this code
const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_test_...');

const charge = await stripe.charges.create({
  amount: 2000,
  currency: 'usd',
  source: 'tok_visa',
  description: 'Example charge'
});
```

**Tomorrow (MCP):**
```
User: "Charge John's card $20 for the consulting session"

AI reasoning:
1. Need to create a charge
2. Amount: $20 = 2000 cents
3. Find customer "John"
4. Use saved payment method
5. Call create_charge(amount=2000, customer_id="cus_123", 
                      description="Consulting session")
```

**Developer only provides:**
```python
@app.mcp_tool()
def create_charge(
    amount: int,  # in cents
    customer_id: str,
    description: str
) -> Charge:
    """
    Create a charge on a customer's payment method.
    Amount must be in cents (e.g., $20.00 = 2000).
    """
    # Business logic unchanged
    return stripe.Charge.create(
        amount=amount,
        customer=customer_id,
        description=description
    )
```

### Implementation Notes

💡 **Pro Tip:** Start by adding MCP endpoints alongside REST, not replacing them. This allows gradual migration and supports both traditional and AI-native clients.

⚠️ **Common Pitfall:** Don't just rename REST endpoints to tools. MCP tools should be semantic ("create_payment") not HTTP-centric ("POST /payments").

📊 **Research Finding:**
Tool description quality significantly impacts function calling accuracy[8]. Research shows that:
- High-quality, diverse training data is critical for function calling capability[9]
- Clear, semantic tool descriptions with good examples improve LLM performance
- Vague or poorly documented tools lead to reduced accuracy and increased failures

**Best practice:** Invest time in clear tool descriptions with concrete examples. The quality of your tool documentation directly correlates with AI agent success rates.

---

## Change 2: UI Layer (Hardcoded → Dynamic)

### The Transformation

```
FROM: Developer decides which components to render
TO: LLM decides UI based on user intent and data
```

### Why It Matters

The same data can (and should) be presented differently based on:
- **User's question**: "Show me sales" vs. "What's trending?"
- **Data characteristics**: Few items → List, Many items → Table
- **Context**: Follow-up question vs. initial query
- **User preferences**: Learned over time

### Traditional Approach

```typescript
// OrdersPage.tsx
function OrdersPage() {
  const [orders, setOrders] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Always fetch and render as table
    fetch('/api/orders').then(setOrders);
  }, []);
  
  // Developer hardcodes: Always show as table
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Your Orders</h1>
      <OrdersTable orders={orders} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Result:** Every user sees the same table, regardless of what they're trying to accomplish.

### AI-Native Approach

```typescript
// No hardcoded component - AI decides

User: "Show me my orders"
AI Decision: User wants to see all orders → Render table

User: "Which order is arriving soonest?"
AI Decision: User wants one specific order → Render card

User: "How's my spending been this month?"
AI Decision: User wants analysis → Render chart

// Same data source, different presentations
```

### Real-World Example: Notion AI

**Notion AI adapts presentation based on context:**[10]

Notion AI can summarize existing content by extracting key points, with presentation adapting to the current page context. The AI considers:
- Current page structure (empty, table, timeline, etc.)
- User's intent (summary, comparison, timeline)
- Data characteristics

```
User in empty page: "Summarize quarterly goals"
→ AI renders: Bullet point summary

User in page with database: "Summarize quarterly goals"
→ AI renders: Summary with AI database properties

User asking for comparison: "Compare Q1 and Q2 goals"
→ AI renders: Comparison format

User in timeline view: "Summarize quarterly goals"
→ AI renders: Timeline with milestones
```

### The Rendering Decision Process

```python
# Pseudo-code for AI rendering logic
async def render_for_user(user_query: str, data: Any) -> UIComponent:
    intent = classify_intent(user_query)
    data_characteristics = analyze_data(data)
    conversation_context = get_recent_context()
    
    if intent == "comparison":
        return ComparisonTable(data)
    elif intent == "trend_analysis":
        return LineChart(data)
    elif intent == "find_specific":
        return HighlightedCard(data)
    elif len(data) < 5:
        return List(data)
    else:
        return PaginatedTable(data)
```

### Implementation Approaches

#### Option 1: AI Generates UI Code (Claude Artifacts)

```
User: "Show me sales by region"

AI generates:
<artifact type="react">
  <BarChart data={salesByRegion} />
</artifact>

User: "Actually, show it as a map"

AI updates artifact:
<artifact type="react">
  <GeographicMap data={salesByRegion} />
</artifact>
```

**Pros:** Maximum flexibility
**Cons:** Security concerns, performance overhead

#### Option 2: AI Selects from Component Library

```python
# AI chooses from predefined components
available_components = [
    DataTable(supports=["sorting", "filtering", "pagination"]),
    BarChart(supports=["comparison", "trends"]),
    LineChart(supports=["time_series"]),
    PieChart(supports=["distribution"]),
    Card(supports=["single_item", "highlight"])
]

# AI reasoning
if user_intent == "compare_categories":
    return BarChart(data=results, group_by="category")
```

**Pros:** Safer, predictable, performant
**Cons:** Limited to predefined components

#### Option 3: Hybrid (Recommended)

```
Predefined components for common cases
+ AI-generated for unique visualizations
+ Fallback to text/table if unsure
```

### The Hybrid Reality

**Most applications will maintain traditional UI for:**
- Complex workflows (video editing, CAD design)
- Precision tasks (pixel-perfect designs)
- Power user features (keyboard shortcuts, bulk operations)
- Legal requirements (explicit consent flows)

**AI-native interface for:**
- Information retrieval
- Routine transactions
- Natural language queries
- Exploratory analysis

### Example: Replit Agent vs. Replit IDE

**Replit provides both conversational and traditional interfaces:**[11][12]

```
Simple request: "Create a todo app"
→ Replit Agent (AI-native conversational interface)
→ Generates files, writes code from natural language
→ "Tell Replit Agent your app idea, and it will build it for you"

Complex debugging: "Why is line 47 causing a race condition?"
→ Drop into IDE (traditional UI)
→ Set breakpoints, inspect state, step through code
→ Full IDE features for precise control

The user seamlessly switches between modalities based on task complexity.
```

**Real-world impact:** Companies using Replit Agent report significant productivity gains. For example, AllFly rebuilt their app in days, slashing development costs by $400K+ and increasing productivity by 85%[12].

### Implementation Notes

💡 **Pro Tip:** Design your component library to be "intent-aware" with metadata about what each component is best for.

⚠️ **Common Pitfall:** Don't make everything conversational. Some tasks are genuinely better with traditional UI.

📊 **User Preference Research:**[13]
A study of 175 participants found that **70% preferred ChatGPT-powered conversational interfaces** over traditional methods, citing convenience, efficiency, and personalization. Key findings:
- Conversational interfaces: 4.2/5 average rating
- Traditional methods: 3.5/5 average rating
- 71% of consumers prefer voice searches over typing[14]

**Task suitability:**
- **Information retrieval**: Conversational interfaces excel
- **Routine transactions**: Conversational preferred
- **Complex creative tasks**: Traditional UI often better
- **Precision work**: Traditional UI provides finer control

## Change 3: Analytics (Clicks → Conversations)

### The Transformation

```
FROM: Track page views, clicks, time-on-page
TO: Track intent recognition, conversation completion, goal achievement
```

### Why It Matters

In AI-native apps, users don't click through pages—they converse. Traditional metrics become meaningless or misleading.

### Traditional E-Commerce Analytics

```javascript
// Google Analytics tracking
ga('send', 'pageview', '/products');
ga('send', 'event', 'Product', 'click', 'Laptop-123');
ga('send', 'event', 'Cart', 'add', 'Laptop-123');
ga('send', 'pageview', '/checkout');
```

**Metrics tracked:**
- Page views per route
- Click-through rate on products
- Add-to-cart conversion rate
- Checkout abandonment rate
- Time on each page

**Funnel:**
```
Homepage (1000 visitors)
    ↓ 40% click category
Category Page (400)
    ↓ 30% click product
Product Page (120)
    ↓ 25% add to cart
Cart (30)
    ↓ 60% checkout
Purchase (18)

Conversion: 1.8%
```

### AI-Native Analytics

```python
# Conversation tracking
conversation_logger.log({
    'conversation_id': 'conv_123',
    'user_query': 'I need a laptop for programming',
    'intent_recognized': 'product_search',
    'intent_confidence': 0.94,
    'tools_called': ['search_products', 'filter_by_specs'],
    'turns_to_completion': 3,
    'goal_achieved': True,
    'user_satisfaction': 5
})
```

**Metrics tracked:**
- Conversation starts
- Intent recognition accuracy
- Tool call success rates
- Turns to goal completion
- Conversation abandonment
- User satisfaction (explicit or inferred)

**Semantic Funnel:**
```
Conversations Started (1000)
    ↓ 95% intent recognized correctly
Intent Recognized (950)
    ↓ 92% correct tools called
Tools Executed Successfully (874)
    ↓ 88% goals completed
Goals Achieved (769)
    ↓ 85% user satisfied
Satisfied Users (654)

"Conversion": 65.4% (goal achievement)
```

### Key Metric Changes

| Traditional Metric | AI-Native Metric | Why It Changed |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Page views | Conversation starts | No pages to view |
| Bounce rate | Intent recognition failure | User leaves if AI doesn't understand |
| Click-through rate | Tool selection accuracy | AI's, not user's choice |
| Time on page | Turns to completion | Conversation depth matters |
| Conversion rate | Goal completion rate | Did user achieve their intent? |
| Cart abandonment | Conversation abandonment | Why did conversation fail? |

### The New Dashboard

#### Conversation-Level Metrics

```python
{
  "total_conversations": 10234,
  "avg_conversation_length": 4.2,  # turns
  "completion_rate": 0.87,  # 87% reached goal
  "abandonment_rate": 0.13,
  "avg_satisfaction": 4.3  # out of 5
}
```

#### Intent-Level Metrics

```python
{
  "intent": "product_search",
  "recognition_accuracy": 0.94,
  "avg_tools_called": 2.1,
  "success_rate": 0.91,
  "common_failures": [
    "ambiguous_product_description",
    "out_of_stock_handling"
  ]
}
```

#### Tool-Level Metrics

```python
{
  "tool": "search_products",
  "calls_per_day": 5234,
  "success_rate": 0.97,
  "avg_latency_ms": 234,
  "error_types": {
    "timeout": 12,
    "invalid_params": 8,
    "auth_failure": 3
  }
}
```

### Real-World Example: Banking Voice Assistant

**Traditional mobile banking:**
```
Tracked:
- Login rate
- Feature usage (transfers, bill pay)
- Screen views per session
- App crashes

Problem: High feature usage but users complaining about complexity
```

**AI-native voice banking:**
```
Tracked:
- "Check balance" intent: 94% accuracy
- "Transfer money" flow: 87% completion
- High-value transfers: 100% trigger approval
- Error recovery: 91% successful

Insight: Users abandoning when amount confirmation unclear
→ Improved confirmation phrasing
→ Completion rate increased to 94%
```

**The difference:** AI-native metrics revealed *why* users struggled (unclear confirmation), traditional metrics only showed *that* they struggled (abandonment).

### Attribution in AI-Native

Traditional: "User clicked ad, viewed 3 pages, purchased"
AI-Native: "User asked 'budget laptops for students', AI suggested X, user purchased"

**New questions:**
- Which tool recommendations lead to conversions?
- Which conversation patterns indicate high intent?
- What intent → tool → outcome paths are most successful?

### Implementation Notes

💡 **Pro Tip:** Track the full conversation context, not just final outcomes. Failed conversations often reveal product gaps.

⚠️ **Common Pitfall:** Don't ignore traditional metrics entirely. Latency, error rates, and system health still matter.

📊 **Recommended Thresholds (Production Best Practices):**

Based on production AI-native applications, teams typically target:
- **Conversation completion**: >85% (conversations that achieve user's goal)
- **Intent recognition**: >90% (AI correctly understands what user wants)
- **Tool execution success**: >95% (tools execute without errors)
- **User satisfaction**: >4.0/5.0 (explicit or inferred ratings)

These are starting points—adjust based on your application's criticality and user expectations. Financial or healthcare applications may require higher thresholds.

## Change 4: Testing (Deterministic → Probabilistic)

### The Transformation

```
FROM: Tests that always pass or always fail
TO: Tests that pass X% of the time, with statistical thresholds
```

### Why It Matters

LLMs are probabilistic. The same query might trigger slightly different tool calls or phrasings. Traditional binary pass/fail testing doesn't work.

### Traditional Testing

```python
# Unit test - Always deterministic
def test_create_order():
    order = create_order(user_id="123", items=["A", "B"])
    assert order.status == "pending"
    assert order.total == 100
    assert len(order.items) == 2

# This either passes (100%) or fails (0%)
```

### AI-Native Testing

```python
# Intent recognition test - Probabilistic
@pytest.mark.llm_test
async def test_order_creation_intent():
    test_cases = [
        "I want to buy items A and B",
        "Add A and B to my order",
        "Purchase products A and B",
        "Get me A and B"
    ]
    
    results = []
    for query in test_cases:
        response = await ai_agent.process(query)
        results.append({
            'correct_tool': response.tool == 'create_order',
            'correct_params': 'A' in response.params and 'B' in response.params
        })
    
    # Statistical assertion
    accuracy = sum(r['correct_tool'] for r in results) / len(results)
    assert accuracy >= 0.95  # Passes if ≥95% correct
```

### The New Testing Pyramid

```
        Traditional              AI-Native
        
       /\                       /\
      /E2E\                    /Scen-\
     /Test \                  /arios \
    /--------\               /--------\
   / API     \              / Intent  \
  /  Tests    \            / & Tool   \
 /-------------\          /   Tests    \
/ Unit Tests   \        /______________\
/________________\     / Deterministic \
                      /  Backend Tests  \
                     /____________________\
```

**New layer: Scenario Tests**
- Test complete user journeys
- Multiple turns, context-dependent
- Success = conversation achieves goal

### Types of AI-Native Tests

#### 1. Tool Selection Tests

```python
def test_payment_tool_selection():
    """AI should choose correct payment tool for various phrasings"""
    queries = [
        ("Charge John $50", "create_charge"),
        ("Bill customer 50 dollars", "create_charge"),
        ("Refund Jane's payment", "create_refund"),
        ("Give Jane her money back", "create_refund")
    ]
    
    correct = 0
    for query, expected_tool in queries:
        result = ai_agent.select_tool(query)
        if result.tool == expected_tool:
            correct += 1
    
    accuracy = correct / len(queries)
    assert accuracy >= 0.95
```

#### 2. Parameter Extraction Tests

```python
def test_amount_parameter_extraction():
    """AI should correctly extract amounts in cents"""
    test_cases = [
        ("Charge $50", {"amount": 5000}),
        ("Charge fifty dollars", {"amount": 5000}),
        ("Bill them 50 bucks", {"amount": 5000}),
        ("Charge $50.99", {"amount": 5099})
    ]
    
    correct = 0
    for query, expected_params in test_cases:
        result = ai_agent.extract_params(query)
        if result['amount'] == expected_params['amount']:
            correct += 1
    
    assert correct / len(test_cases) >= 0.98  # Higher threshold for critical data
```

#### 3. Multi-Turn Scenario Tests

```python
@pytest.mark.scenario
async def test_purchase_flow():
    """Complete purchase conversation"""
    conversation = Conversation()
    
    # Turn 1: Initial request
    r1 = await conversation.user_says("I want to buy a laptop")
    assert r1.calls_tool("search_products")
    assert "laptop" in r1.tool_params.get("query", "")
    
    # Turn 2: Refinement
    r2 = await conversation.user_says("Under $1000")
    assert r2.calls_tool("search_products") or r2.calls_tool("filter_products")
    assert r2.tool_params.get("max_price") <= 1000
    
    # Turn 3: Selection
    r3 = await conversation.user_says("I'll take the second one")
    assert r3.calls_tool("add_to_cart")
    
    # Turn 4: Checkout
    r4 = await conversation.user_says("Checkout")
    assert r4.calls_tools_in_sequence(["get_cart", "create_order", "charge_payment"])
    
    # Overall assessment
    assert conversation.completed_successfully()
    assert conversation.turn_count <= 6  # Efficiency check
```

#### 4. Error Recovery Tests

```python
@pytest.mark.error_recovery
async def test_payment_failure_recovery():
    """AI should gracefully handle payment failures"""
    conversation = Conversation()
    
    # Set up: User tries to checkout
    await conversation.user_says("Checkout my cart")
    
    # Inject failure
    inject_error("payment_declined")
    
    # AI should:
    response = await conversation.get_next_ai_response()
    
    assert response.detected_error == True
    assert "declined" in response.user_message.lower()
    assert response.suggests_alternative == True  # e.g., different card
    assert response.maintains_cart_state == True  # Doesn't lose the cart
    
    # Recovery flow
    recovery = await conversation.user_says("Try my other card")
    assert recovery.calls_tool("charge_payment")
    assert recovery.uses_alternative_payment_method == True
```

### Evaluation Datasets (New Concept)

```python
# Golden dataset - curated test cases
evaluation_dataset = {
    "name": "Order Management v1.0",
    "test_cases": [
        {
            "id": "ORD-001",
            "query": "Show my recent orders",
            "expected_tool": "get_user_orders",
            "expected_params": {"limit": 10, "user_id": "{current_user}"},
            "weight": 1.0
        },
        {
            "id": "ORD-002",  
            "query": "Where's my laptop?",
            "expected_sequence": [
                ("search_orders", {"query": "laptop"}),
                ("get_order_tracking", {"order_id": "{found_order_id}"})
            ],
            "weight": 2.0  # Harder, worth more
        },
        # ... 100+ test cases
    ],
    "thresholds": {
        "overall_accuracy": 0.95,
        "critical_operations": 0.98,
        "error_recovery": 0.90
    }
}
```

### Continuous Evaluation

```bash
# Run evaluation suite
$ python evaluate.py --dataset order_management_v1.json --model claude-sonnet-4.5

### Implementation Notes

💡 **Pro Tip:** Collect failing production cases and add them to your evaluation dataset. This prevents regression.

⚠️ **Common Pitfall:** Don't set thresholds too low. 80% accuracy might seem okay, but means 1 in 5 users have problems.

📊 **Recommended Testing Thresholds:**

Production teams typically set statistical thresholds based on operation criticality:
- **Simple operations** (e.g., "show my orders"): 98%+ accuracy target
- **Complex multi-step flows** (e.g., purchase journey): 95%+ acceptable
- **Error recovery scenarios**: 90%+ minimum (can users recover from failures?)
- **Security-critical operations** (e.g., payments, permissions): 100% required—no probabilistic testing

**Rationale:** 80% accuracy = 1 in 5 users experience issues = unacceptable for production. Even 95% accuracy means 1 in 20 users may encounter problems, so monitor carefully and improve continuously.

## Summary: What Changed

| Layer | Change Type | Impact |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **API Protocol** | Modified | High - affects all client interactions |
| **UI Layer** | Transformed | Extreme - complete rethinking of UX |
| **Analytics** | Transformed | High - new metrics, dashboards, insights |
| **Testing** | Transformed | High - new methodologies, tools, processes |

**Common thread:** All changes stem from the shift to **intent-driven, AI-orchestrated** interactions. The application must adapt to users rather than users adapting to the application.

## Key Takeaways

✓ **API protocol changes from REST to MCP** but it's still just a protocol—architecture stays the same

✓ **UI becomes dynamic** with AI deciding what to show based on intent, not hardcoded by developers

✓ **Analytics track conversations and intent** not clicks and page views

✓ **Testing becomes probabilistic** requiring statistical thresholds and evaluation datasets

✓ **All changes are manageable** with incremental adoption and hybrid approaches
